paddler
=======

Silly game - clone of an old DOS game which doesn't seem to have made it to the net. That one was written in COBOL! This one's in Python. This was basically put together as a demonstration of basic curses use. This will only run on Linux, as it's built to work with curses and not unicurses.

Hit "\" to place a paddle in front of the ball.

Hit "/" to place a different paddle in front of the ball.

Don't let the ball run off the screen.
